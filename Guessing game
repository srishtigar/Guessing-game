#Guessing game in Python 
#In this game, a random number between 1 and 80 is generated using the randint function. The player has to guess the number, and the program provides hints if
# the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. After each game, the player can choose to play again or exit.

print("I am thinking of a number between 1 to 80. Can you guess what it is?")
